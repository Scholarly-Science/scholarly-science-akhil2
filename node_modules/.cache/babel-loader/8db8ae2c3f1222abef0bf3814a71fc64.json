It is the first university offering\n                  management courses where students pay their fees to college\n                  only once they get placed during their final year. Once a\n                  student is placed, the student needs to pay 10 times their\n                  Monthly Gross Salary as the Tuition Fees (Pre-Incentives) to\n                  Sunstone Eduversity after their placement. The university also\n                  has a Money-Back Guarantee Program where the fees will be\n                  completely refundable if the student does not get placed\n                  within 3 months of graduation.\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"para\">\n                  Interesting, right? Sunstone eduversity is truly changing the\n                  education industry and students right now are in need of such\n                  programs only which can give the promisable future to the\n                  students.\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
